# Probabilistic-Modeling-and-Analysis-of-Network-Congestion-and-Queue-Delay
This project studies network congestion and queue delay using probabilistic models. Packet arrivals and service times are treated as random events. Queueing models like M/M/1 are simulated in Python to analyze waiting time, delay, throughput, and packet loss under different traffic loads.
