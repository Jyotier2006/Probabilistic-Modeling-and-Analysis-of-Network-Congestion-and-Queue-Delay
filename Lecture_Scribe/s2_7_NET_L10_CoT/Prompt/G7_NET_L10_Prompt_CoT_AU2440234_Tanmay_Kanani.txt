Create a lecture scribe using only the provided lecture slides and textbook context. The scribe should work as reliable reference material for exam preparation and should accurately reflect what was taught in the lecture so that it can be used for revision. While writing the scribe, explain definitions, notation, assumptions, theorem statements or results, formulas, algorithms, proofs, derivations and worked examples step by step following the same logical reasoning used in the lecture. Include all important steps, mathematical expressions and conclusions needed to understand and reconstruct the concepts during exam revision. Use only the provided lecture slides and textbook context. Do not add any new explanations, examples, assumptions, formulas or reasoning that are not present in the given materials. Write in a formal academic style and organize the scribe clearly so that the flow of concepts, definitions, results, algorithms, proofs and examples is easy to follow during revision.
