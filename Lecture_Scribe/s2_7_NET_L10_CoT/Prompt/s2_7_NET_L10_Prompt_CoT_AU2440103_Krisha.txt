Generate a lecture scribe suitable for exam preparation. While writing the scribe, explain the definitions and assumptions explicitly, give step-by-step reasoning for definitions, assumptions, proofs and the example step-by-step solutions from the provided context only. All the reasoning should be based solely on the provided context. Make the logical flow explicit so that a student can follow the reasoning during revision. Do not introduce material that is not present in the context.
