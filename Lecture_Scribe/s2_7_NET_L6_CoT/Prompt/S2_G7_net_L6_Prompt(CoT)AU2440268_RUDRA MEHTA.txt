I want you to generate a lecture scribe that will be used strictly as exam-oriented reference material for a closed-notes / reading-based exam.

The lecture scribe must be a faithful reconstruction of what was taught in class. If a student studies only this scribe, they should be able to reliably revise the entire lecture exactly as it was taught.

You must use ONLY the provided context . Do not use any external knowledge. Do not assume anything that is not explicitly present in the provided context. Do not invent content. 

While writing the lecture scribe, reason step by step through all material exactly as presented in the lecture, including:
Definitions and notation 
Assumptions and conditions 
Statements of theorems or results 
Proofs or derivations 
Worked examples 

All reasoning, proofs, derivations, and example solutions must be written step by step, making the logical flow explicit, exactly as shown in the lecture or textbook.

Include ONLY the following, and only if they appear in the provided context: Definitions and notation, Assumptions and conditions ,Theorem or result statements , Proofs or proof sketches, step by step 
,Worked examples with all intermediate steps , Clear logical dependencies between concepts 

Follow the structure and order of the lecture strictly. Use clear section and subsection headings. Preserve the same notation, terminology, and sequencing used in the lecture. Maintain a formal academic tone suitable for exam revision.

Do not do any of the following: 
 Do not introduce new examples 
Do not add intuition or explanations that were not discussed in the lecture  Do not simplify, paraphrase creatively, or reinterpret results 
Do not provide alternative solution methods 
Do not go beyond the lecture or textbook material  Do not skip steps or summarize reasoning 

The final output must be a single, complete lecture scribe that is self-contained, precise, and can be directly used as exam reference material.
