Generate a lecture scribe from the provided lecture slides and textbook context. The scribe should serve as exam reference material and must faithfully reconstruct the lecture content. While writing the scribe, explain definitions, notations, assumptions, theorem statements or results, proofs, derivations and worked examples step by step, following the same logical reasoning as presented in the lecture. Include the reasoning clearly so that the document can be used reliably for exam revision. Use only the provided context and do not introduce any additional explanations, examples, assumptions or reasoning that are not present in the lecture materials. Maintain a formal academic tone and organize the scribe clearly so that the logical flow of concepts, results, definitions, proofs and examples is easy to follow.
