Generate a lecture scribe intended to serve as exam-oriented reference material.Use only the provided context (lecture slides and relevant textbook excerpts).While writing the scribe, reason step by step through all definitions, notation,assumptions, theorem statements, proofs, derivations, and worked examplesexactly as presented in the lecture materials. Make the logical flow explicitso that a student can reliably follow the reasoning during exam revision.Include proofs, derivations, and examples only if they appear in the providedcontext. Do not introduce new explanations, examples, or material beyond thelecture scope. Maintain a formal academic tone and strict faithfulness to thelecture structure.
